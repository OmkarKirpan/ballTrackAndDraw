# ballTrackAndDraw
Ball tracking and drawing on the screen.

###Requirements:
- OpenCV 3.0
- Python 3

###How to use:
1. Use "python3 ballTracking.py" to start the program.
2. Click the object you want to track on the screen, and you will get the HSV value in the terminal.
3. Click as much as you can so that you can ensure the range of HSV colors for the selected object.
4. Change the range of HSV colors in the code, and restart the program.
5. Now you can track the object, and try to press "x" to activate the drawing function which can be stopped by pressing "x" again.
6. You can also press "c" to clear the screen, and you can draw another painting.
